Congenital heart diseases are challenging to diagnose due to the complex nature of heart anatomy and function. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on expert interpretation of echocardiogram data, which can lead to inconsistencies. 

This project focused on developing a prototype to diagnose congenital heart disease (CHD) using echocardiogram data. The lack of an available database necessitated the creation of a synthetic dataset, which was then used to implement and test a fuzzy logic-based diagnostic model. The model aimed to classify patients into categories such as Normal, Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), or Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) based on key echocardiogram parameters.
